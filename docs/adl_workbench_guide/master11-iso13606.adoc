= ISO 13606

== Overview

A draft version of the ISO 13606-1:2008 schema for the AWB has been developed, along with some example archetypes. This is intended to show how ADL / AOM 2 functions for archetypes built on a different reference model, and also to enable organisations working with ISO 13606 to have a more formal tool basis for developing archetypes, templates and generally migrating to ADL/AOM 2. The entire ISO 13606 model can be viewed in the AWB RM schema and Class tools, and comparisons can be made with classes in the openEHR reference model.

== ISO 13606 schema for AWB

An initial schema for ISO 13606-1 has been included in the set of RM schemas used by AWB. This was produced by Christoph Rinner (Medical University of Vienna) and Thomas Beale (Ars Semantica). The definitive copy of this resides in the {openehr_reference_models_github}[openEHR reference-models GitHub repository]. If you are interested in being added to the committers list to work on this schema, please email webmaster at openehr.org.

== Comparison of 13606 and openEHR Classes

The entire ISO 13606 model can be viewed in the AWB RM schema and Class tools, and comparisons can be made with classes in the openEHR reference model.

== ISO 13606 archetypes

Some initial 13606 archetypes have been created in the {openehr_adl_archetypes_github}/tree/master/Example/EN13606[adl-archetypes Github repository^]. These are currently purely experimental and unreviewed.
