= Installation Notes

== Mac OS X

ADL Workbench will be installed in your Applications folder, under a folder called openEHR.

When you double-click the ADL Workbench icon, it will start up inside X11 or XQuartz.

== Linux

The Linux version of ADL Workbench requires GTK+ 2.4.0 or above. You can check by typing this command: 

----
pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0
----

The command should succeed and the version number of GTK+ should appear. If it is not 2.4.0 or above then you need to install GTK+ 2.4.0.

After downloading, create a directory, extract the contents of the archive, and run adl_workbench. This is normally done as follows:

[source, bash]
----
$ mkdir awb 						# create a directory if never done before
$ cd awb
$ tar xvjf ../archive_file_name		# extract the files
----
